    "1. Convolutional Layers:\n",
    "* Convolutional  layer are the core building block of a CNN. These layers apply a convlution operation to the input data, passing the result to the next layers\n",
    "* Filter/ Kernels: Small matrices that slide over the input image and perform element-wise multiplication and summation.\n",
    "* Stride: The number of pixels by which the filter matrix shifts over the input matrix.\n",
    "* Padding: Adding zeros arout the matrix to ensure the filter fits properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Activation functions:\n",
    "* After the convolution operation, an activation function is applied to introduce non-linearity into the model\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pooling Layers:\n",
    "* Pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the feature map, retaining the most importat information while reducing computational complexity.\n",
    "* Max Pooling: Takes the maximum value in a specified window. (eg. 2x2)\n",
    "* Average Pooling: Takes the average value in a specified window.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fully Connected Layers:\n",
    "* After several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-level reasoning in the neural network is done via fully connec layers. The output from the convolution/ pooling layers is flattened and passed through one or more fully connected layers\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Output layer:\n",
    "* The final layer of CNN is often a fuuly connected layer with a softmax function (for classification tasks) or linear activation function (for regression task)"
